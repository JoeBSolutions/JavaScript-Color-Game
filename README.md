JavaScript Color Game
 
This is a Js based game where I want to have an RGB color text listed ( example: 56,30,90) listed at the top along with either 3 or 6 boxes of random colors beneath depending on the difficulty selected. Each time you select the wrong color, the incorrect box selected will disappear and tell you to try again until the correct color is selected. It will then say you won and you will then have to select a replay button to reset and play again.
